All individual files needed for 3d printing and metal cutting and bending are already exported and are in dedicated
folders.

Please check separate pages with the  **[Components List](v1.0/components.md)** and  **[Assembly instructions](v1.0/assembly.md)** for more details.

### Electronics
This version of mechanics is not dependent on specific controller, and it can be any of your choice. As an option you can select one **[based on ODrive controller board](https://github.com/o-devices/bldc-ffb-joystick)**.
